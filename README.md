Password Manager - by Furstukin

V1.0

Installer will install package to a folder named Password Manager in the location you install from, but you can specify a custom location if desired.

Start the program by running PasswordManager.exe


USAGE NOTES:

Use the gear icon to open the settings and add your default email and username.

Passwords you save will be added to the password list.

The passwords will be sorted alphabetically, but Uppercase is sorted before Lowercae so Amazon will be at the top and amazon would be below Warby Parker.

Use the radio buttons to auto-populate your default name or email address.

Use the four password charactor options to adjust how many uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols will be used to generate a new password.

Note: for maximum strength, all passwords will contain only unique values for each charactor option.

To delete a password from your list select it and use the "Delete Record" button.

If you attempt to save a password for a site that is already in the password list it will ask you to confrim you want to 	update the record.

Note: Entries are case sensitive so Amazon and amazon are seen as seperate entries.
